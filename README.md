## About

Hundreds of thousands of families world-wide struggle with the difficulties associated with raising a child with developmental disabilities.  While therapy is important, healthcare professionals cannot always be present to log data relating to behavioral incidents. Thus, the onus lies with the parents to be able to log these occurances.  There is already enough pressure on the parents of children with developmental disabilities, so there needs to be an easier, quicker way for parents to log this data.  That quicker way is here with the ABC Data Logger.
